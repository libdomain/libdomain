## 1. Introduction
This specification documents the system level requirements for the libdomain project. The objectives of this specification are to provide a system overview including definition, goals, objectives, context, and major capabilities.

This specification is organized into following sections:
* [Introduction](#1-introduction), which introduces the specification for libdomain to its readers.
* [Product Overview](#2-product-overview), which provides a brief, high level description of the libdomain including its definition, and its goals.
* [Requirements](#3-requirements), which holds list of functional requirements and key qualify indicators.
* [Verification](#4-verification), which provides the verification approaches and methods planned to qualify the software.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
### 2.2 Product Functions
Main features, which are offered by the library:
* Manage LDAP entries: add, update, replace, delete.
* Loading object and class schemas from LDAP service or from local source.
* Searching objects by submitting search queries.
* Creating or modifying objects by providing changes in LDIF format.
* Multiple connection strategies: sync, async, mock sync, mock async.
* Additional abstraction layer to create LDAP objects and attributes and perform their verification.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Target users are software developers.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
List of design and implementation constraints:
* Library must be implemented using C programming language.
* Library must utilize CMake as build system.

### 2.6 User Documentation
Documentation for end users will be made available from project site. README.md file will contain link to the documentation page.
Set of documentation will be developed alongside with source code in restructuredtext and markdown formats.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 External Interface Requirements
This section and subsequent subsections provide detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the software. 
This section and subsections should include both content and format as follows:
